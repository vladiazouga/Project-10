In this repo I created an html page to showcase http requests that were from the studentserver.js file
(I had to create a public folder for all the html files so the index.html can work)
Each HTML page has its own task:
- addStudent.html: create a new student. 
- updateStudent.html: update a student by ID 
- deleteStudent.html: delete a student by ID 
- displayStudent.html: display a single student by ID 
- listStudents.html: list all students records
