In this repo http requests are used to manipulate the studentserver.js file
(I had to create a students folder for the requests to work)
Each HTTP request had its own task:
- POST: create a new student. 
- PUT: update a student by ID 
- DELETE: delete a student by ID 
- GET: display a single student by ID 
- GET: list all students
